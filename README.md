## Description

A trainee created the code in the app/Controllers/HomeController.php.

This controller retrieves content from an RSS feed and call a news api. The result is filtered to fetch those containing images and verify if aren't duplicated.
This script should get an image from each page.

The lead developer is not satisfied by this result, so you need to improve it.

## Questions:
1. What do you suggest improving the run time of this script?
2. How can we make this script scalable (make it support thousands of image sources)
